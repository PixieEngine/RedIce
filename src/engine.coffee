  ###*
  The Engine controls the game world and manages game state. Once you 
  set it up and let it run it pretty much takes care of itself.

  You can use the engine to add or remove objects from the game world.

  There are several modules that can include to add additional capabilities 
  to the engine.

  The engine fires events that you  may bind listeners to. Event listeners 
  may be bound with <code>engine.bind(eventName, callback)</code>

  @name Engine
  @constructor
  @param {Object} I Instance variables of the engine 
  ###

  ###*
  Observe or modify the 
  entity data before it is added to the engine.
  @name beforeAdd
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  @param {Object} entityData
  ###

  ###*
  Observe or configure a <code>gameObject</code> that has been added 
  to the engine.
  @name afterAdd
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  @param {GameObject} object The object that has just been added to the
  engine.
  ###

  ###*
  Called when the engine updates all the game objects.

  @name update
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  ###

  ###*
  Called after the engine completes an update. Here it is 
  safe to modify the game objects array.

  @name afterUpdate
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  ###

  ###*
  Called before the engine draws the game objects on the canvas. The current camera transform is applied.

  @name beforeDraw
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  @params {PixieCanvas} canvas A reference to the canvas to draw on.
  ###

  ###*
  Called after the engine draws on the canvas. The current camera transform is applied.

  <code><pre>
  engine.bind "draw", (canvas) ->
    # print some directions for the player
    canvas.drawText
      text: "Go this way =>"
      x: 200
      y: 200 
  </pre></code>

  @name draw
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  @params {PixieCanvas} canvas A reference to the canvas to draw on.
  ###

  ###*
  Called after the engine draws.

  The current camera transform is not applied. This is great for
  adding overlays.

  <code><pre>
  engine.bind "overlay", (canvas) ->
    # print the player's health. This will be
    # positioned absolutely according to the viewport.
    canvas.drawText
      text: "HEALTH:"
      position: Point(20, 20)

    canvas.drawText
      text: player.health()
      position: Point(50, 20)
  </pre></code>

  @name overlay
  @methodOf Engine#
  @event
  @params {PixieCanvas} canvas A reference to the canvas to draw on.

      Start the game simulation.

      Pause the game and step through 1 update of the engine.

      @methodOf Engine#

      ###*
      Query the engine to see if it is paused.

      <code><pre>
      engine.pause()

      engine.paused()
      # true

      engine.play()

      Change the framerate of the game. The default framerate is 30 fps.
